NBody.java: this is the main executable code.

The program simulats the motion of N objects in a plane, accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton¡¯s Law of Universal Gravitation.

It then draws an animation of bodies floating around in space tugging on each other with the power of gravity.
